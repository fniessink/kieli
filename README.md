### How it works

Toisto quizzes you repeatably until  words and phrases. A quiz can be to translate a word or phrase

For each quiz, Toisto counts how often you answered it correctly in a row. So each quiz has its own streak. When you answer a quiz correctly, increasing its streak, Toisto will silence the quiz for a while. The longer the streak, the longer a quiz is silenced.

When you stop the program (hit Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D), progress is saved in a file named `.toisto-progress.json` in your home folder.

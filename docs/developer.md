## How to keep dependencies up-to-date

Python dependencies are kept up-to-date via a Dependabot GitHub action that checks for updated dependencies and creates pull request automatically.

The [IANA language subtag registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry) needs to be copied into the repository by hand, from time to time.
